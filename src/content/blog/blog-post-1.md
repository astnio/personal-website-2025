I found out this supports Github markdown, so things like colors `#ffffff` might work.

See `rgb(9, 105, 218)` and `hsl(212, 92%, 45%)` for more examples.

## Project One

Yup, this is a sweet example of a post made for a project. This is meant to convey all sorts of information.

```js
const example = 'String Example!';

function doStuff() {
  console.log(example);
}
```

Above is a code snippet. Let's see if I can get these to work!

```js
const example2 = 'more examples!';

function doStuff() {
  console.log(example2);
}
```
