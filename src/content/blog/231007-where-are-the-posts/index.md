Hello, I am back after about two weeks of silence after initiating this blog.

So I think I need to make a review to go over what is required of me to keep this blog alive, and obviously one of those things is to post more frequently. One of the issues I had was that I wanted to create a full, "proper" guide on SQL, and I had created a graphic and even made a good amount of progress on the post. However, the more I wrote, the more I realized how much I don't know.

This normally wouldn't be an issue, but I wanted to make it as accurate and usable as possible for others to read. At this point I believe this is a mistake to focus on that. It takes too much time to create a quality guide, and I simply have too much going on in terms of classes and personal projects that take up more of my time right now.

Instead, I will be taking these posts in more of a "weekly review" kind of approach. Before my intention was to create well written and well thought out articles on what I was learning, but from now on I simply will be making weekly reviews about what I learned and how I feel. My problem with this is that it doesn't serve others very well, but at this point I believe I simply need to get into the habit of writing more regularly and recalling information I learned throughout the week, and the point of this blog was to help me learn and retain what I learn. My experience is simply being broadcast to the public for all to see.

I also thought of an idea for utilizing categories to help people figure out which is stuff I intend to be a proper guide, and what is just me rambling about what I did or learned. This may be obvious to a lot of you, but I can just categorize my ramble posts with "Personal Review" or something along those lines, and my guides and tutorials as "Guides" and "Tutorials". Yes, very groundbreaking way of sorting information.

My posts should become more frequent from now on, and I will try and get them done at least once a week. I plan on doing a "proper" weekly review tomorrow, talking about what I learned the week before and what I must learn for the following week. This post was quite short, but I just wanted to get something out for now. Stay tuned for more.
