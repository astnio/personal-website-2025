Ah, honey, your first novel. Will you take care of that? Ah, honey, your first novel. Thank god I still got my hair. What on Earth is that thing I'm wearing? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father.

I gotta go, uh, I gotta go. Thanks very much, it was wonderful, you were all great. See you all later, much later. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. But I can't go to the dance, I'll miss my favorite television program, Science Fiction Theater. Now that's a risk you'll have to take you're life depends on it. What?

Whoa, wait a minute, Doc, are you telling me that my mother has got the hots for me? Ah, where're my pants? Oh, I've been so worried about you ever since you ran off the other night. Are you okay? I'm sorry I have to go. Isn't he a dream boat? Look me up when you get there, guess I'll be about 47. Hey boy, are you alright?

Well, what if they didn't like them, what if they told me I was no good. I guess that would be pretty hard for somebody to understand. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Will you take care of that? The keys are in the trunk. Yeah, he's right here.

This is uh, this is heavy duty, Doc, this is great. Uh, does it run on regular unleaded gasoline? Your, your right. Yeah okay. Kids, we're gonna have to eat this cake by ourselves, Uncle Joey didn't make parole again. I think it would be nice, if you all dropped him a line. Who do you think, the Libyans.

Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. He's a very strange young man. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? What, right here right now in the cafeteria? What if she said no? I don't know if I could take that kind of rejection. Besides, I think she'd rather go with somebody else. Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly.

What, what is it hot? Ho, you mean you're gonna touch her on her- Uh? Ronald Reagon. Uh, Doc.

Biff, stop it. Biff, you're breaking his arm. Biff, stop. You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went her, he was a slacker too. Say, why do you let those boys push you around like that? Something that really cooks. Alright, alright this is an oldie, but uh, it's an oldie where I come from. Alright guys, let's do some blues riff in b, watch me for the changes, and uh, try and keep up, okay. Lynda, first of all, I'm not your answering service. Second of all, somebody named Greg or Craig called you just a little while ago.

I'm telling the truth, Doc, you gotta believe me. He's fine, and he's completely unaware that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ. Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. What did you say? Good evening, I'm Doctor Emmet Brown, I'm standing here on the parking lot of- Listen, Doc.

I'm, I'm sorry, Mr. McFly, I mean, I was just starting on the second coat. What's with the life preserver? Doc, look, all we need is a little plutonium. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty.

Jennifer. Well, Marty, I want to thank you for all your good advice, I'll never forget it. Why thank you, Marty. George. Good morning, sleepyhead, Good morning, Dave, Lynda I can't play. Oh.

But you're good, Marty, you're really good. And this audition tape of your is great, you gotta send it in to the record company. It's like Doc's always saying. Doc. Of course, the Enchantment Under The Sea Dance they're supposed to go to this, that's where they kiss for the first time. I think you got the wrong car, McFly. George: you ever think of running for class president?
