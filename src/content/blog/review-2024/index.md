Merry Christmas to anyone reading this! As I am writing this, is is the early morning of the day of Christmas Eve. Seems odd to pick this as the time of me writing, but the urge struck and I wanted to use this chance while I had it.

This has perhaps been the busiest year of my life. I started the year off already busy. First of all, I had entered a brand new relationship with my partner. That was both an incredible and anxious experience at the time, especially having come out of a bad end to the year, having failed some classes. I started strong, though, as I started a new quarter of courses and got a full-time job along with them. Despite struggling to juggle between my relationship, work, class, and family, I somehow made it through and passed all my classes. After finishing up my academic quarter, I then switched jobs again to restart my position as a part-time graphic designer for my colleges student engagement department.

After having begun a new quarter, I have once again ended strongly, earning myself a 4.0 GPA this quarter, and the first 4.0 I had ever earned in my life! Quite a strong ending to my academic life at my college, should I say so myself.

However, with the end of year comes an end to many things, besides just my classes. I also will be having to leave my job as a graphic designer, as this position required me to keep a student status. I have no interest of staying as a student, so I will be leaving this job. Many other things in my life may be ending as well, but with endings come many new beginnings as well. Quite a bittersweet ending to my year.

I am now looking to my future, with a desire to get into the web development industry. I only hear rumors of how difficult it is to get into this industry, at least as a new/junior developer. While I search for my job, I am continuing to hone my skills. Right now my focus is on learning React, a frontend library to make websites and user interfaces using JavaScript.

My classes actually ended on December 8th, and I had thought that with the end of my classes (and job) would come more time to focus on my development, yet I have remained as busy as ever. Well, more busy in a non-busy sense. I have not been working on anything I have personally really wanted to as of late. Instead, I have been spending time with my partner and assisting my family for the holidays. Admittedly, I have also been spending this holiday to relax myself. Plenty of time has been spent playing some video games like Valheim and Hogwarts Legacy. Valheim is one I have been playing for a couple years now, but Hogwarts Legacy is one I just got as it was on a pretty great sale recently.

Nothing else has really been going on as far as programming projects or anything, though. I am looking to change this soon, but I don't want to announce anything yet as to not jinx myself! I will be releasing stuff as I am ready. Lots of stuff is planned, though.

The rest of the holidays will likely be light on updates and productivity, so I wouldn't expect much more until late January or early February. I need extra time to prepare myself for a new job, and setting up some new projects.

This marks the end of this brief review, as I don't actually have many insights right now. Most of my efforts this year were simply just working and completing classwork. There are a lot of things in store for the future, though, so I hope you all stay tuned and have a good holiday!
