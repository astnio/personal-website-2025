## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I can't say I learned too much from this project, however I am happy to say that it was much quicker to put together, as many parts of this project were also used on previous projects. Doing these challenges has made me quite familiar with more patterns, making me faster and more effecient and completing designs.

### Continued development

I am still looking to speed up my development of websites and become more effecient.
