## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript

### What I learned

Since I personally lack experience in working with forms more often, this challenge helped me a lot in getting the hang of them more. In particular with using them in JavaScript. I had some other personal projects I made before that involved checkboxes, but it had been a while since then, and this challenge was a good way to get back into it.

### Continued development

I had some issues with calculating the tip, which is ironic because I thought that would have been the easy part. The issue was that I kept misunderstanding how numbers and floats were cast in JavaScript, and I made a lot of my if-statements too complicated. I ended up with a bit of a simpler solution, however this made me miss working with TypeScript more.
