# My Personal Site, 2024

Another year, another rework of my personal website! This time I am using SvelteKit, Skeleton, and Tailwind.

It was not stricly necessary to use SvelteKit for this, however I wanted to both learn more about server side rendering and I wanted to keep my site expandable for the future. Right now I am using SSR to fetch my blog posts from my other site (byaustin.net) to show them in my About section on this site. Currently I am hosting this site using Netlify.
