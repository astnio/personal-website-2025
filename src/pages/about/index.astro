        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm a developer from Washington state with a passion for
          creating beautiful, functional web experiences. My journey into web
          development hasn't been linear, but that's what makes it interesting.
        </p>

        <h2>My Development Story</h2>
        <p>
          Programming has been a constant interest throughout my life. I started
          with C++ and worked into C# and desktop application development. For
          years, I built Windows applications. I always struggled with making
          them look the way I envisioned, though. Styling desktop apps felt like
          fighting against the tools rather than working with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I got into web development and discovered CSS, everything
          changed. What seemed weird and backwards at first suddenly became
          intuitive. For the first time, I could make interfaces look exactly
          how I imagined them. That breakthrough moment rekindled my love for
          JavaScript and opened up a whole new world of possibilities in web
          development.
        </p>

        <h2>What I'm Working On</h2>

        <p>
          Currently, I'm focusing on front-end development, and diving deep into
          modern JavaScript frameworks and advanced CSS techniques. I love the
          creative problem-solving that comes with UI design and the
          satisfaction of turning mockups into interactive experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          But I'm not stopping there. I'm actively learning backend development
          to become a full-stack developer, exploring server-side technologies
          and database management. DevOps and deployment strategies are next on
          my learning roadmap. I want to understand the complete journey from
          code to production.
        </p>

        <!-- <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>

    <p>
      When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring 3D art and animation.
      There's something magical about sculpting and modeling in digital space
      that scratches the same creative itch as building user interfaces. I'm
      working with various 3D software and love how it complements my
      development skills.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also gearing up to dive into game development, where I can merge my
      programming background with my love for interactive experiences and 3D
      art. The intersection of technology and creativity is where I feel most at
      home.
    </p> -->

        <h2>What Drives Me</h2>

        <p>
          I'm fascinated by the moment when technology becomes invisible â€“ when
          users can accomplish their goals effortlessly because the interface
          just makes sense. Whether it's a smooth animation, an intuitive
          navigation flow, or a perfectly responsive layout, I'm always chasing
          those moments of seamless user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the best solutions come from understanding both the
          technical constraints and the human needs behind every project. Every
          line of code is an opportunity to make someone's day a little easier
          or a little more delightful.
        </p>

        <h2>Let's Connect</h2>

        <p>
          I'm always excited to talk about web development, 3D art, upcoming
          game projects, or that perfect CSS trick that finally made everything
          click. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to collaborate or just
          chat about the craft!
